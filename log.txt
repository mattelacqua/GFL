                                        assignment

11/21   12:30pm         3:00            Implemented what seemed like would be the solution 
                                        (Partitions bad)

11/27   4:30pm          4:00            Lots of testing new hyperparemeters, automated testing
                                        with no luck at all. Very frustrating.

11/30   9:30pm          1:00            found the bug... negated winning on accident.

DISCUSSION:
*************

Issues: Partitions, hyperparemeters, bad results / varying results, and a single 'not'

This assignment was uniquely challenging for me. I have done q-learning before for some other research projects,
and I had some more trouble with this one than expected. Given the state approximations, initially, my largest issue
was that I was unable to find a good partition. I think that the issue in this is that once my partition was getting
better, my reuslts would change, and then I would keep adjusting to subpar hyperparemeters, etc. It seemed like 
an endless loop of optimization errors and fine tuning. 

Then I found it. I had been negating the check to see if we were at a terminal position when setting the expected
value of the next state. All of a sudden I was getting convergence and was able to fine tune appropriately.

I had some basic issues with timing, however I just put a pad in and so far it has been fine. 

Other than thosee obstacles, I haven't seemed to have much trouble.
